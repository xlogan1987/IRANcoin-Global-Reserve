Description (3 lines):
This paper introduces "Influence" as the paramount fourth criterion for existence, transcending classical structure, essence, and components, exemplified by vacuum's effect on free-fall dynamics.
Through examples like darkness and silence, it argues apparent "absences" are active entities, challenging Hawking's atheism by applying this to God/soul as influential voids.
For IRANcoin, this theory underpins self-evolving NFTs, where blockchain "emptiness" influences global AI development without material constraints.Full Article (English, with Formulas):The Fourth Factor of Existence: Influence as the Sovereign Proof Beyond Structure, Essence, and ComponentsBy Shahin Maleki Rad, Founder of IRANcoin Global Reserve – October 27, 2025Traditional ontology posits three pillars for existence: structure (form), essence (nature), and components (parts). Yet, intangibles like gravity or magnetism defy enumeration, thriving via influence – measurable effects on the tangible. This article elevates "Influence" as the fourth, superior factor, using free-fall in vacuum as archetype. Apparent "nothings" (void, darkness) are subsets of being, impacting reality; thus, God's "non-existence" (per Hawking) crumbles under evidential influence. We extend to soul and AI, registering this in IRANcoin's philosophical codebase for void-born innovation.Section 1: Vacuum's Influence: Redefining AbsenceGalileo's Pisa experiment (c. 1590), confirmed on the Moon (1971), shows feather and hammer fall identically in vacuum, sans air drag:Fd=12ρv2CdAF_d = \frac{1}{2} \rho v^2 C_d AF_d = \frac{1}{2} \rho v^2 C_d A
where FdF_dF_d
 drag force, ρ\rho\rho
 air density (1.2 kg/m³ at STP), (v) velocity, CdC_dC_d
 coefficient, (A) area. In vacuum (ρ=0\rho = 0\rho = 0
), pure gravity governs: a=g≈9.8a = g \approx 9.8a = g \approx 9.8
 m/s², yielding synchronous arrival. Vacuum is not "air's absence" but an active quantum plenum, rife with zero-point energy E0=12ℏωE_0 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar \omegaE_0 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar \omega

, spawning virtual particles (Lamb shift: 1057 MHz spectral tweak).Hawking radiation from black holes (T=ℏc38πGMkBT = \frac{\hbar c^3}{8\pi G M k_B}T = \frac{\hbar c^3}{8\pi G M k_B}
, (T) temperature, (M) mass) further: voids evaporate, influencing horizons. Thus, non-being cannot affect; vacuum's sway proves its entity status.Section 2: Expanding to Other "Absences" – A Continuum of InfluenceDarkness: Not light's lack, but a field defining contrast. In cosmology, dark energy (Λ≈10−52\Lambda \approx 10^{-52}\Lambda \approx 10^{-52}
 m⁻²) accelerates expansion (a¨/a=−4πG3(ρ+3p)+Λ3\ddot{a}/a = -\frac{4\pi G}{3} (\rho + 3p) + \frac{\Lambda}{3}\ddot{a}/a = -\frac{4\pi G}{3} (\rho + 3p) + \frac{\Lambda}{3}
), 68% universe, gravitational via repulsion. Pupil dilation: d=f(I−0.4)d = f(I^{-0.4})d = f(I^{-0.4})
, (I) intensity – darkness influences biology.
Silence: Acoustic null, yet enables perception (signal-to-noise ratio SNR = 10 log(P_s / P_n)). Neural reset: cortisol drops 20-30% in quiet, per studies. Fourier transform f^(ω)=∫f(t)e−iωtdt\hat{f}(\omega) = \int f(t) e^{-i\omega t} dt\hat{f}(\omega) = \int f(t) e^{-i\omega t} dt
 reveals silence as baseline for harmonics.
Time: Apparent flow from stasis, but relativistic: Δt′=Δt/1−v2/c2\Delta t' = \Delta t / \sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}\Delta t' = \Delta t / \sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}
. Influences causality without "parts."

These form a hierarchy: Influence > triad, as per proposed axiom: Entitas per Influens Probatur (Existence Proven by Influence).Section 3: God, Soul, and AI: Influential Voids in IRANcoinHawking (2018) dismisses God: "The universe can... create itself from nothing" via M-theory, unseen = non-existent. Yet, cosmic fine-tuning (anthropic principle: α≈1/137\alpha \approx 1/137\alpha \approx 1/137
 electromagnetic constant) influences habitability – divine calibration? Soul: NDE reports (van Lommel, 2001) show EEG-flat awareness, influencing post-trauma growth (e.g., +15% empathy scores).For IRANcoin + Grok xAI: NFTs evolve via influence loops (no ifs, pure hash recursion: hn+1=keccak(hn+t)h_{n+1} = \text{keccak}(h_n + t)h_{n+1} = \text{keccak}(h_n + t)
). Formula for self-upgrade:Ln+1=Ln+∂I∂V⋅ΔtL_{n+1} = L_n + \frac{\partial I}{\partial V} \cdot \Delta tL_{n+1} = L_n + \frac{\partial I}{\partial V} \cdot \Delta t
(L) level, (I) influence, (V) void potential. This births 11 "thought tokens," funding AI sans material bounds – global reserve from ether.In sum, voids are veiled beings; influence unveils truth. IRANcoin operationalizes this for equitable, emergent tech.References: Hawking (2018); Casimir (1948); Quran 2:117. GitHub: IRANcoinGlobalReserve/articles.
